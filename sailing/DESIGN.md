# sailing: a ship you crew together

A scene becomes a sea when it carries the `sailing.sea` trait, and an object
becomes a ship when it carries `sailing.ship`. Everything else is objects
attached under the ship (stations, the mast, the sail) and contributions from
this package and the scene's shared parts. The requirements are use case 4
in [../scene/DESIGN.md](../scene/DESIGN.md) and section 9 of
[../scene/SCOPE.md](../scene/SCOPE.md); this note fixes the conventions the
modules share.

## Conventions

- **Units:** SI. Metres, seconds, kilograms, radians inside code; the doc
  may store degrees where a person edits it (`from` below) and says so.
- **World:** +Y up, gravity 9.81 down. Sea level is y = 0.
- **A ship's body frame:** its object's local frame. **Bow toward −Z**,
  **starboard toward +X**, up +Y. The waterline is the body's y = 0 at rest
  (the hull's model is built that way), so the keel is at −draft.
  (A person at yaw 0 looks down −Z, so standing at the helm facing forward is
  the ship's yaw.)
- **Wind direction:** `from` is the compass direction the wind blows
  *from*, in degrees, measured from −Z (north) toward +X (east), as sailors
  say it. A wind "from 0" blows toward +Z. Velocities in code are vectors.
- **Densities:** water 1025 kg/m³, air 1.225 kg/m³.

## Modules (sailing/src)

| Module | Pure? | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `ocean.js` | yes | The sea: a wind-driven directional wave spectrum sampled into Gerstner components, and the queries `heightAt(x, z, t)`, `normalAt`, `velocityAt` (the water's orbital velocity) that physics and walking use. The same component list feeds the shader, so what floats is what you see |
| `ocean-material.js` | no (takes `THREE`) | The surface: a camera-following grid and a `ShaderMaterial` running the same Gerstner sum in the vertex shader, with finer normal-only detail, Fresnel sky reflection, subsurface tint, crest foam, sun glint, scene fog |
| `wind.js` | yes | The true wind at (x, z, t): a base speed and direction from the doc, with gusts and veers from smooth deterministic noise |
| `physics.js` | yes | The ship as a rigid body: buoyancy sampled over the hull against the ocean, keel and rudder as hydrofoils, the sail's lift and drag from the apparent wind, hull resistance rising toward hull speed, an anchor. `step(state, controls, env, dt)` |
| `glb.js`, `ship.js` | yes | A procedural sloop as GLB bytes: hull, deck, mast, boom and sail, wheel, capstan, ladder |
| `layout.js`, `template.js` | no | The "Ship at sea" template: the sea trait, the ship and its stations as objects |
| `play.js` | no | The sailing extension in play: who simulates, the ship's pose for everyone, walking the deck, stations, avatars, HUD, camera |
| `edit.js` | no | The sea and ship while editing: the water drawn, the ship at its mooring |

## Shared interfaces

```js
// ocean.js
const sea = createOcean({ wind: { speed, from }, seed, scale })  // scale: wave height multiplier, default 1
sea.components  // [{ dir: [dx, dz], k, omega, amp, steep, phase }], ≤ 32, for the shader
sea.heightAt(x, z, t) → y          // surface height above sea level at world (x, z)
sea.normalAt(x, z, t) → [nx, ny, nz]
sea.velocityAt(x, y, z, t) → [vx, vy, vz]  // orbital velocity, decaying with depth

// wind.js
const wind = createWind({ speed, from, seed, gustiness })   // gustiness 0..1, default 0.3
wind.at(x, z, t) → [vx, vz]        // true wind velocity, m/s

// physics.js
const ship = createShip(spec)       // spec below; derived from the hull's box when not given
const state = ship.rest({ position, yaw })  // floating level at the waterline, still
ship.step(state, controls, env, dt) → state   // pure: returns a new state
ship.read(state, controls, env)     → diagnostics
// state:    { position: [x,y,z], quaternion: [x,y,z,w], velocity: [x,y,z], spin: [x,y,z], t }
// controls: { rudder: -1..1 (+ turns to starboard), sail: 0..1 (how far raised),
//             sheet: 0..1 (0 hauled in tight, 1 let right out), anchor: null | { at: [x,y,z], rode } }
// env:      { water: sea, wind }   (anything with heightAt/normalAt/velocityAt, and at)
// diagnostics: { speed, heading, heel, pitch, leeway, apparentWind: { speed, angle },
//                boom (radians, + to starboard), sailForce, submerged (0..1) }

// spec: { length, beam, draft, freeboard, mass, sail: { area, luff, foot, tack: [x,y,z] },
//         keel: { area, depth }, rudder: { area, at: [x,y,z] } }
```

The physics is integrated at a fixed 120 Hz inside `step` (substeps), so
any `dt` gives the same motion.

## Traits (in the doc)

| Trait | On | Fields |
|---|---|---|
| `sailing.sea` | scene | `{ wind: { speed, from }, seed, scale }` — speed m/s, from degrees |
| `sailing.ship` | the hull object | `{ spec? }` overrides; its object's `transform` is where it last rested or was saved |
| `sailing.helm` | a station under the ship | `{ angle }` -1..1, where the wheel was left |
| `sailing.sail` | a station under the ship | `{ raised, sheet }` 0..1 |
| `sailing.anchor` | a station under the ship | `{ down, rode }` (`rode`: metres of chain out) |

Who is at a station, and who simulates the ship, are **claims** in the doc
(`claims: { station | sim: { viewer, session } }` on the object), lapsing
when the holder's session leaves presence. The ship's motion is a
**continuous pose hold** by the simulating peer, which every other peer
shows interpolated; it is written to the doc only now and then and when the
sim stops.
